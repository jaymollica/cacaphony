            Mechanized Cacophony is an interactive online sound work that explores how experiences of nature are mediated by technology. It is inspired by the artistsâ€™ recent experiences of and during lockdown. The artists, working remotely, are each capturing sounds from a variety of sources, both field recordings and online. What culminated was a series of experiments, using AI as a material to generate GAN videos replicating a desire- a series of mechanized, virtual places pulling from real videos and sounds recorded from ocean views. These views feel far away, almost untouchable, and unreal- much like a memory becoming more distant and fading over time. Similar to the isolation of lockdown, both artists are using technology as a series of love letters to what they miss the most, nature. Caroline and Anna want to bring out this duality and tension in the work and create orchestral layered soundscapes that can be controlled and experienced at home.
