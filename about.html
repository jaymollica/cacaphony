          Mechanized Cacophonies is a short experimental work that explores how experiences of nature are mediated by technology. It is inspired by the artistsâ€™ recent experiences of and during lockdown. Both artists' work on art and machine learning is based on a practise that involves creating their own datasets. The pandemic restrictions over the summer meant that they could only use what was readily available around then, producing an audio and visual database of nature that was necessarily curtailed.  What culminated from this was a series of experiments, using AI as a material to create a series of mechanized, virtual places pulling from real videos and sounds recorded from sea views. These views feel far away, almost untouchable, and unreal- much like a memory becoming more distant and fading over time. They are bringing out this duality - the real and the fake -  in the work and create orchestral layered soundscapes that can be controlled and experienced at home.
